My app has four main functions, view, add, edit, and delete.

The home page is viewNotes component. When the page is loaded, you will see all the notes that are stored on the database. You will be able to view all your notes there. By pressing the notes icon in the navbar, it will also bring you back to home page.

The Navigation bar has a addNote button on the far right of it. If you click that button, it will open a component and it will look for a Note heading and what you would like to write in it. Mininmum requirement is a note heading. Click save to add the note and home page will load up again with your new note.

The edit button on each note brings up the note so you can edit the heading and or body of the note. Click edit when you are finished editing your note. The edit button will send the changes to the server to store it and then the home page will laod up again on your screen with the change to the note.

The delete button when pressed will bring up a "Are you sure" alert. If yes is clicked, the note will be deleted.

Thats all folks. I hope you enjoy the app.
